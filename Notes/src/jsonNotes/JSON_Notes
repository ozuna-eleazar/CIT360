JSON Notes

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight syntax for exchanging data 
that is designed to be understood easily by humans, and parsed easily by machines. 
As the name implies, JSON is based on the JavaScript scripting language;
however, JSON itself is completely language independent.

Because JSON has a smaller footprint than XML, it is ideal for conditions where 
network speeds are limited. For example, mobile devices often have slower 
connections and so benefit from a smaller download.

JSON is defined by two basic structures.

1. Name/value pairs
2. Ordered list of values

A value can be any one of the following types, and these structures can be nested:

1. String (Unicode)
2. Number
3. Boolean (true or false)
4. Array
5. Object
6. null (empty)


Small Example of an object that has 3 fields
{
    "name": "John",
    "age":  35,
    "member": false
}


Creating JSON is often referred to a process known as serialization, where you basically
serialize (convert) the data to a human readable output; in this case JSON. There are 
many different ways to handle serialisation of data to JSON and many different ways 
of embedding objects in the JSON. The problem comes when you wish to deserialize the 
JSON, convert the JSON back to your object.
