Class Diagram

Shows a collection of static model elements such as classes and types, their contents, and their relationships.

Typically Class Diagrams are used for:

1. Explore domain concepts in the form of a domain model
2. Analyze requirements in the form of a conceptual/analysis model 
3. Depict the detailed design of object-oriented or object-based software

A class icon is simply a rectangle divided into three compartments. The topmost compartment
contains the name of the class. The middle compartment contains a list of attributes (member variables),
and the bottom compartment contains a list of operations (member functions).

The basics:
1. a class
2. an interface
3. a data type
4. a component.

As a rule of thumb, keeping class diagrams as simple as possible allows them to be more easily understood 
and appreciated by different types of audiences. For this purpose, remember to label your classes and 
relationships as descriptive as possible.
