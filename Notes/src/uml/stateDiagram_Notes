State Diagram

Describes the states an object or interaction may be in, as well as the transitions between states.
Formerly referred to as a state diagram, state chart diagram, or a state-transition diagram. 
A state diagram describes the behavior of a single object in response to a series of events in a system. 
Only use state diagrams for classes where it is necessary to understand the behavior of the object 
through the entire system. Not all classes will require a state diagram.

So the most important purpose of state chart diagram is to model life time of an object from creation to termination.


Main purposes of a State Diagram:

1. To model dynamic aspect of a system.
2. To model life time of a reactive system.
3. To describe different states of an object during its life time.
4. Define a state machine to model states of an object.


The basic elements are rounded boxes representing the state of the object and arrows indicating the
transition to the next state. The activity section of the state symbol depicts what activities the 
object will be doing while it is in that state. 

Before drawing a Statechart diagram:

1. Identify important objects to be analyzed.
2. Identify the states.
3. Identify the events.
