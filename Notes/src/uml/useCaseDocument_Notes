Use Case Document

There is a lot of documentation associated with Use Cases that needs to be organized somehow.
In real life, the Use Cases for a small system will be fairly well worked out before work
begins on building the system.

Large system tend to work more in parallel, so some people will work on Use Cases, while others
start building code for the Use Cases already completed.
