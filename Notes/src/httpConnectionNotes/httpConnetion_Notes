HTTP Connection Notes

Most network-connected Android apps will use HTTP to send and receive data. 
Android includes two HTTP clients: HttpURLConnection and Apache HTTP Client. 
Both support HTTPS, streaming uploads and downloads, configurable timeouts, 
IPv6 and connection pooling.

An example I found online that demonstrates how to retrieve a webpage at android.com

URL url = new URL("http://www.android.com/");
   HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   try {
     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
     readStream(in);
    finally {
     urlConnection.disconnect();
   }
 }
 
 This example performs and upload: 
 
 HttpURLConnection urlConnection = (HttpURLConnection) url.openConnection();
   try {
     urlConnection.setDoOutput(true);
     urlConnection.setChunkedStreamingMode(0);

     OutputStream out = new BufferedOutputStream(urlConnection.getOutputStream());
     writeStream(out);

     InputStream in = new BufferedInputStream(urlConnection.getInputStream());
     readStream(in);
    finally {
     urlConnection.disconnect();
   }
 }
