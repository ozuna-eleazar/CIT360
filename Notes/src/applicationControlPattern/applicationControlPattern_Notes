Application Control Pattern


- Is a centralized point for handling screen navigation and flow of an application.
- To control UI transition logic in a central place.
- Centralize the flow of the application and screen navigation so you can change 
flow or logic in a single location.
- For complex process we can define multiple controllers. 


By centralizing decision points and controls, the controller also helps reduce 
the amount of Java code, called scriptlets, embedded in the JavaServer Pages (JSP) page.

The controller is the initial contact point for handling all requests in the system. 
The controller may delegate to a helper to complete authentication and authorization 
of a user or to initiate contact retrieval.

- Improves modularity
- Improves reusability
- Improves extensibility
