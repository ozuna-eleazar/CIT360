***Collections Map***

The java.util.Map interface represents a mapping between a key and a value. 
The Map interface is not a subtype of the Collection interface. Therefore it 
behaves a bit different from the rest of the collection types.

Since Map is an interface you need to instantiate a concrete implementation
of the interface in order to use it. 
The most commonly used Map implementations are HashMap and TreeMap.

HashMap maps a key and a value. It does not guarantee any order of the elements
stored internally in the map.
TreeMap also maps a key and a value. It guarantees the order in which
keys or values are iterated - which is the sort order of the keys or values.

Examples of creating a map instance:
Map mapA = new HashMap();
Map mapB = new TreeMap();

To add elements to a Map you call its put() method.
mapA.put("key1", "element 1");
mapA.put("key2", "element 2");
mapA.put("key3", "element 3");

You can then obtain the value using the key. To do that you use the get() method.
String element1 = (String) mapA.get("key1");

You remove elements by calling the remove(Object key) method. You thus remove 
the (key, value) pair matching the key.



***Collections List***

It represents an ordered list of objects, meaning you can access the elements 
of a List in a specific order, and by an index too. You can also add the same 
element more than once to a List.

To add elements to a List you call its add() method. This method is inherited 
from the Collection interface. 

Examples:
List listA = new ArrayList();

listA.add("element 1");
listA.add("element 2");
listA.add("element 3");

listA.add(0, "element 0");

The order in which the elements are added to the List is stored, so you can 
access the elements in the same order.


You can remove elements in two ways:
remove(Object element)
remove(int index)

remove(Object element) removes that element in the list, if it is present. 
All subsequent elements in the list are then moved up in the list.
remove(int index) removes the element at the given index. All subsequent 
elements in the list are then moved up in the list.
