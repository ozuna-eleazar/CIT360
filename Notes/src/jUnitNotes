JUnit Notes

JUnit is a simple, open source framework to write and run repeatable tests. It is an instance 
of the xUnit architecture for unit testing frameworks. JUnit features include:

1. Assertions for testing expected results
2. Test fixtures for sharing common test data
3. Test runners for running tests

JUnit was originally written by Erich Gamma and Kent Beck.

Some Benefits Include: 

1. Finds problems early
2. Facilitates change. Readily available unit tests make it easy for the programmer to check 
whether a piece of code is still working properly.
3. Every time you make a small or a big modification in the code (in any function), you can 
make sure that the function is performing well and has not broken any older functionality by 
executing all JUnit test cases in one go written for that function.
4. Any new member in the team can easily understand the test cases written and managed using 
JUnit and consequently contribute towards writing more test cases for developing a robust software.
5. JUnit has become a standard for testing in Java programming language and is supported by almost
all IDEÕs e.g Netbeans, Eclipse etc. So, you work in any standarized IDE environment, you would 
find the support of JUnit in it.

Tests should be written before the code. Test-first programming is practiced by only writing
new code when an automated test is failing.

Whenever a customer test fails or a bug is reported, first write the necessary unit test(s) 
to expose the bug(s), then fix them. This makes it almost impossible for that particular 
bug to resurface later.
